//! # minibytes
//!
//! This create provides the [`Bytes`] type. It is similar to `&[u8]`: cloning
//! or slicing are zero-copy. Unlike `&[u8]`, `Bytes` does not have lifetime.
//! This is done by maintaining the life cycle of the underlying storage using
//! reference count.
//!
//! Aside from supporting `Vec<u8>` as the underlying storage, [`Bytes`] also
//! supports [`memmap::Mmap`]. Libraries can implement [`BytesOwner`] for other
//! types to further extend storage support.
